## Backend

The Bare Server backend used is from [tomphttp/bare-server-node/examples/static.mjs](https://github.com/tomphttp/bare-server-node/blob/master/examples/static.mjs)


## Config
To change the HTTP server port set the environment variable variable `PORT` (the default is 8080).

### SSL Config
To enable SSL place your certificates in the SSL folder.

The certificate should be named `cert.pem` and the private key named `key.pem`.

When SSL is enabled port 443 will be used as the default.
